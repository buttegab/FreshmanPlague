###An Epidemiological Story
Starring: Matthew Ruehle, Sean Carter, and Gabriel Butterick

##Abstract
We plan to investigate infectious disease spread through a network of socially and spacially connected nodes. The nodes will be agents, in so much as they will interact and maintain randomly generated, unique characteristics. We want to examine the way characteristics affect the spread of disease, what characteristics contribute to contracting disease, and what distributions of characteristics lead to the population being all sick or all well by the end.

The purpose of this paper is to examine optimization avenues available to agent based models of infectious disease transmission. The bulk of the paper revolves around describing the models, the optimizations for the models, and the resulting efficiency gains of the optimization. A more promising optimization they pursued was in clustering agents based on state and selectively performing calculations in order to avoid needless computation.

This paper investigates the way that the preferences of agents can allow information about evacuation warnings to spread throughout a social network. It used variations of trust distribution, strategy for seeding the information, to explore the diffusion process.


##Experiments
Take an existing model, like one of those used in the Lander Willem paper, and try an optimization not included in their paper. This would give us a basic starting point for a model that we didn't have to generate ourselves that we could then try and make faster. Our results for this would be graphs modeling the time/space requirements for various attempted optimizations versus the original implementation. If we could accomplish optimizations in either time or space in such a way that there wasn't a large increase in requirment of the other (less space more time and vice versa), we would consider the project a success.

Using the Hui paper and its model for simulating the diffusion of information, we could generate a basic model for disease transmission. The proposed model in the paper uses strength of connections, or "trust", to determine how fast information spreads. If we took that connection model and changed it to disease transmission, we would have disease spreading better accross some connections than others. We would use this to simulate roomate pairs or strong friendships to demonstrate the increased contact between those agents and the increased likelihood of disease transmission. We want to have a network diagram represent the state of the system at the beginning and end of the system in an effort to show the effect of social connection on disease spread. We want to represent the intermediate period of the model running via animating a cellular automata based off the social network. We want to show trends in characteristics over time, rate of sickness growth dependent on characteristic concentration, and any other important traits.
